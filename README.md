# OddshotFeed
## Disclaimer
I am releasing version 2 of my bot I wrote for Oddshot (but kept it private). This version contains support for self posts, link posts and the ability to upload to Facebook and YouTube. This version comes as-is and undocumented. The new version works better than the original bot and it has decently written code. We've used it on /u/OddshotFeed until we decided to shut it down. There is no known bugs and it doesn't skip posts occasionally like it used to.

This version uses a modified version of raw.js (v0.4.0). Full credits to the original author of the module.
